### proofs!!

* Direct proof - simple if then proof.
* Proof by contrapositive - since a statement and its contrapositive are equal you can prove the contrapositive with a direct proof which proves the original statement by contrapositive.
* proof by contradiction - if not p is not true then there is a contradiction and p must be true.
