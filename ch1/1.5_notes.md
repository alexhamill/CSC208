### set proofs

* $A \subseteq B$ A has all the things in B
* $A \cap B$ the set of all A & B
* $A \cup B$ the set all in A or B
* for any sets A, B, and C if $A \subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq C$ then $A \subseteq C$

### Functions

* F : $A \to B$ assigns A (the domain) to B(the co domain)
* A injunctive is just like a one to one function. Every B must have one A as well as every A has one B.
* Solving F(A) just works by imputing every value into the function.
    - A = {1,3,4}
    - F(X) = 2x
    - F(A) = {2,6,8}

### relations

* A relation is how a number relates to another one eg. > < =
* transitive relation are relation where ArB and BrC so ArB
    - such as A > B and B > C so A > C
