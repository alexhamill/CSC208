# graphs intro

- edges are the lines
- verticies are the dots
- verticies are adjecent if they are conected by a edge
- adjecency list is a table with a vertex then what its adject too
* adjecency matrix looks just like a bunch of numbers and wasnt explaned to us futher then one mean adjectent and 0 meaning not.
- degree is number of edges on a vertex.
* a degree sequince is a list of the degrees on the vertexs in a "non-increasing order" whatever that means.
- a graph is connected when their is a path betwee all of the vertices
* a cycle is when you can start at a verticy and come back to it (idk how long a cycle has to be or any specifics about it). this is not adressed in the textbook.
- a tree is when there is no cycles but the graph is connected.
- a graph is just a set of verticies and edges and how we draw it is up to us mostly.
- graphs that arnt equal but just have a verticy in a difrent place. for this we use the $ \cong $
