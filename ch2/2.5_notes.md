# coloring

- coloring vertices is called "vertex coloring"
- if every adjectnt vertex is a difrent color then it is "proper"
- smallest amount of colors is called the chromatic number X(G)
- X(G) has no limit
- In a planner graph X(G) has to be = or less than 4
- X(G) is awlays greater than 1 and less than the number of verticies
- X(G) <= largest degree + 1
- X(G) <= largest degree , unless the graph is compleate or odd cycle

## edge coloring

- Edges are difrent colors is they are incident to the same vertex
- X'(G) chromatic index
- for any graph X'(G) is either X(G) or X(G)+1
