## ulers circuts and trails 

- a trail goes to every verticy while not repeating any edges
- a circut is a trail but has to end up at the same verticy
- adding a spike(verticy with degree 1) makes sure there will be no circuts
- if a verticy has a odd degree that means you cant have a circut 
- if there are is an odd degree the trail must start their
- if there is 2 odd degree then it must start at one amd end at the other and there must be no more than 2 odd degree
- id all vertives are even their is a circut 
- if 2 verticies are odd then it has a trail 
- hamilton goes over verticies only once
