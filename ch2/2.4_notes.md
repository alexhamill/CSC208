## ulers circuts and trails 

- a trail goes to every verticy while not repeating any edges
- a circut is a trail but has to end up at the same verticy
- adding a spike(verticy with degree 1) makes sure there will be no circuts
- if a verticy has a odd degree that means you cant start a circut there
