# triangle
it starts at zero at the top and the left
$\frac{n=the row starts at 0}{k = which one on that row starts at 0}$

### paths

- first add x+y and go to that row then 
- then go to y 
- x+y/y

### bit string
Weight is how many ones their our
$\mathrm{B}_{size of string}^{weight}$

### subset

$\frac{length of set}{length of subset}$

### algebra

each row is 2^n

if you expand (x+1)^n you will get the triangle in the form of coefficients
