# counting 

I have 2 sets 1,2 and a,b,c

- combine sets 1,2,a,b,c 5 items 2 + 3 = 5
- combine outcomes a1,a2,b1,b2,c1,c2 6 items 2 * 3 = 6
- disjoin means they dont affect each other 
- A or B means they need to be added
- A and B means they need to be multiplied 
- 2^number of elements
- (total number! / ((amount you choose)(number of elemts in set - amount you chose)!))
