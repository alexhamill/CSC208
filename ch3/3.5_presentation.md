# Question 1

A multiset is a collection of objects, just like a set, but can contain an object more than once (the order of the elements still doesnâ€™t matter). For example, {1,1,2,5,5,7} is a multiset of size 6.

a. How many sets of size 5 can be made using the 10 numeric digits 0 through 9?

This is just $$\binom{size of input set}{size of outsput set}$ so $\binom{10}{5} = 252$$ 

b. How many multisets of size 5 can be made using the 10 numeric digits 0 through 9?
