## What is discrete math?

I think that discrete math is math that models things in the real world instead of being hugely theoretical. It doesnt use huge numbers that go onto infinity or numbers that get infinitely small like some other field of math.

## What are the four main topics that Professor Levin says will be presented in the book?

1.  Combinations
2.  Sequences
3.  Symbolic logic
4.  Graph logic

## What are discrete structures?

Discrete structures are tools that are used to help see parts of a problem in discrete math.

1. Sets
 * A collection of numbers.
 * Unordered.
 * can be written in many different ways.
   * {1,2,3,4} is the same as {1,1+1,2+1,3+1}
2. Functions
 * rule that assigns each input exactly one output
 * output is called the image.
 * domain all inputs.
 * codomain all valid outputs.
 * range all real outputs.
   
  $ f: X \to Y$
  * F is the name of the function
  * X is the domain
  * Y is the codomain
